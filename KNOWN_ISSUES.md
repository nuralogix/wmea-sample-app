# Known Issues and Limitations

## 1. Constraint Satisfaction on iPhones in Landscape Mode (WMEA-176)

It may be difficult to satisfy measurement constraints on iPhones in landscape mode.

## 2. PartnerId Not Yet Supported (WMEA-10)

PartnerId configuration is not yet supported in the embedded app.

## 3. onCancel Handler Not Wired Up (WMEA-171)

The `onCancel` (appEvents.MEASUREMENT_CANCELED) handler is not yet wired up in the measurement flow, so you cannot yet do custom handling of measurement and camera cancellations.

Camera flipping on the measurement page on mobile devices is not yet supported.
